<span style="font-size:200%">[Intro]</span>
So, we all know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> made the first computer in the world (in 1856) 
it was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine#:~:text=A%20difference%20engine%20is%20an,first%20created%20by%20Charles%20Babbage.">Difference engine</a>
which could perform basic arithmatic operation,
which is cool and all
but ,it was a mechanical computer ,and not electronic..... at all 
the history of the first comletely electronic computer is a lot more complicated than that
so lets go forward in time




<span style="font-size:200%">[WWI]</span>
The world of 1914. A time of modern technology, culture, and fashion.
Truly the height of civilization.

Everyone knew a big war was coming.
France wanted some stuff back that Germany had taken from it,
Germany wanted to take more of EVERYONE'S stuff,
Everyone was talking about each other behind each other's backs.
 
In the city of Sarajevo ,in Austria-Hungary lived some Serbians and Bosnians who hated living in Austria-Hungary.
so, when the Austro-Hungarian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> goes there for a nice drive in an open-top car,with his car's route published in advance.
it went just as well as you'd expect.

Some assassins were waiting for him along the way and threw bombs at his car,
but they missed and blew up some officers behind him, instead.
So, the Archduke goes to visit the injured officers in hospital.
The driver takes a wrong turn and by sheer coincidence gets stuck besides one of the failed assassins.
...Who shoots him.


Austria-Hungary is understandably pissed about all this,
and they think the Serbian government had something to do with it (which they might have).
So they go to their friend Germany and say: "Hey Germany, we're gonna declare a war on Serbia!",
and Germany was all for that.
So Austria-Hungary sends a big list of impossible demands to Serbia
and when Serbia refuses, they declare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">war</a>.

Austria-Hungary and Germany are friends 
but, Serbia is protected by Russia, who's friends with France, so they all declare war as well.
France and Britain also have a kind of alliance.
So they join in too

 
There would be months of fighting and the deaths of thousands in order to gain a few meters or kilometers of land.
Living in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare">trenches</a> was hard work too. 
Corpses, 
mud that could swallow you whole,
pools of poisonous water, 
rats,
disease,
the smell...
It's insane that millions of soldiers put up with these conditions, and commanders ordered them to do so... for years.




<span style="font-size:200%">[Artillary]</span>
The year is 1918, the great war has finally ended,
never to happen again....  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">for about 20 years</a>

The War may have ended ,but the nations kept making deadly weaponery(just in case) 
one of those war machines,is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240_mm_howitzer_M1">M1 240mm Howitzer</a>
an artillary cannon made by the US Military during the second World War
this Behemoth of a machine required a crew of 14 people to operate 
and could fire artillary shell at Mach 2(701m/s) ,with a firing range of 23Km
one of the biggest problems with the Howitzer, is that it required very complex calculations to operate
which was the same problem with other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery">artillary</a> cannons as well,




<span style="font-size:200%">[The ENIAC]</span>
So the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense">US Department Of Defence</a> decided to make a machine that can perform mathematical calculations in seconds
they called it the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>"
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)

ENIAC's design and construction was financed by the United States Army
The total cost was about $487,000, equivalent to $6,600,000 in 2022. The construction contract was signed on June 5, 1943
work on the computer began in secret at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering the following month,
under the code name "Project PX"

ENIAC was designed by Ursinus College physics professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly">John Mauchly</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert">J. Presper Eckert</a> of the University of Pennsylvania, U.S.


ENIAC contained 18,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 
10,000 capacitors, and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. 
It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 tons),
was roughly 8 ft (2 m) tall, 3 ft (1 m) deep, and 100 ft (30 m) long,
occupied 300 sq ft (28 m2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity

it could perform Multiplication of two 10-digit numbers in 2.8 Seconds
and Add 5000 numbers in 1 Second
ENIAC was an engineering masterpiece




<span style="font-size:200%">[Transistors]</span>
ENIAC was discontinued in 1956, as a new technology was being developed

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor#History">Bipolar Transistor</a> invented in 1947
Compared to vacuum tubes
they are much smaller
require less power than vacuum tubes
and give off less heat

and gave rise to The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_computer">Second Generation</a>" of Computers




<span style="font-size:200%">[The Traitorous Eight]</span>
Meanwhile....
in 1957
at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley_Semiconductor_Laboratory">Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley">William Shockley</a> recruited a group of young PhD graduates,
with the goal to develop new semiconductor devices.

Shockley was an experienced researcher and teacher,
and had even recieved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in Physics,
what he wasnt, however, was being good at management, he was really bad at it
so bad that one physicist swore that :

"Shockley could see electrons ,but had trouble seeing people"
and,
"A disasterously bad businessman, and a worse manager"

all this lead to 8 of the PhD students to leave Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory,
and start their own company ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a>

Shockley described their leaving as "Betrayal"
leading to the group being known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight">The Traitorous Eight</a>

one of those eight students was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce">Robert Noyce</a>,
who in 1959 made the first truely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#The_first_integrated_circuits">monolithic IC chip</a>,
which revolutionized computer hardware,
leading to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware_(1960s%E2%80%93present)#Third_generation">Third Generation</a>" of computer technology
